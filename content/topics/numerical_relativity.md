## Codes

- [Engrenage](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/engrenage) is a spherically symmetric BSSN code designed for teaching Numerical Relativity (NR), which is the solution of the Einstein Equations of General Relativity (GR) using numerical methods.
- [Einstein Toolkit](https://einsteintoolkit.org/) is a community-driven software platform of core computational tools to advance and support research in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational physics.
- [GRChombo](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRChombo) is an open-source code for numerical relativity simulations. It is developed and maintained by a collaboration of numerical relativists with a wide range of research interests, from early universe cosmology to astrophysics and mathematical general relativity, and has been used in many papers since its first release in 2015.
